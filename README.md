# letter-finder
My first JavaScript practice repo
This is a small JavaScript project that loops through a word and checks if a specific letter exists in it. It logs the index of matches and non-matches to the console.

## ðŸ’» What It Does

The function `letterFinder(word, match)`:

- Loops through each character in a word
- Compares it to the letter you're looking for
- Prints messages to the console about matches and non-matches

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Writing `for` loops
- Using `if/else` conditions
- Comparing characters in strings
- Calling functions with parameters

## ðŸ“¦ Example Output

```javascript
letterFinder("test", "t");
Found the t at 0  
---No match found at 1  
---No match found at 2  
Found the t at 3
